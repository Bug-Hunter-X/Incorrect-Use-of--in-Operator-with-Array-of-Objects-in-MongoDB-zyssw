This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB queries involving the incorrect use of the $in operator with an array of objects. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected approach.  This issue arises due to a misunderstanding of how MongoDB handles object comparisons within the $in operator.  The solution clarifies how to structure queries for accurate results when dealing with embedded objects within your data.
